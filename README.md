# go-sfomuseum-proj4

There are (seemingly) many wrappers around `proj.4`. This one is ours, at least in advance of `go-spatial/proj`.

## Important

It's too soon. I am still just trying to figure it out...

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.11 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.
